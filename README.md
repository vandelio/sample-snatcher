#Sample snatcher
An audio sample interface in visual format in the browser. 

Waveline zoom, pan, cut, sample directory and other stuff.

This is a project i made in 2018 and ever since, it has only lived locally on my machine.

Initially it could download and import from a specifik source url, but that part is broken now. Maybe ill fix it some day, when my kids dont wanna play no more. 
But the manual import to the interface still works.


# Spin up a MAMP server, with this main directory as root and whatever port you use.
# Go to http://localhost:8888/interface.php?samplepath=input/Piano_Mezmorized_new_v8.mp3_45ae1e5e125206.mp3
# The samplepath audio file is present in the directory.
